1. Install Node.js

Download & install from: https://nodejs.org

Choose LTS version (recommended).

2. Copy Your Project

Copy your pooja-app folder (with server.js, views/, package.json etc.) to the other laptop.

Or zip the folder â†’ transfer â†’ unzip.

3. Install Dependencies

Open terminal inside pooja-app and run:

npm install


ðŸ‘‰ This will read package.json and install express, sqlite3, ejs, etc.

4. Run the App
node server.js


If everything is fine, it will say:

Connected to SQLite database
Server running at http://localhost:3000

5. Open in Browser

On that laptop, go to:
ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:3000

ðŸ”— Access From Mobile (same WiFi)

If you want to open it on your mobile phone without online hosting:

Find the laptopâ€™s local IP address:

Run in terminal (Windows):

ipconfig


Look for IPv4 Address, e.g. 192.168.1.45.

Keep the app running (node server.js).

On your phone (connected to the same WiFi), open:

http://192.168.1.45:3000


ðŸ‘‰ Now your phone can access it too ðŸŽ‰

âœ… So, on another laptop you donâ€™t change the code â€” only run npm install again.

Do you want me to also show you how to make it auto-start when the laptop turns on (so you donâ€™t need to type node server.js every time)?
